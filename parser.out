Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> expression
Rule 1     expression -> expression PLUS term
Rule 2     expression -> expression MINUS term
Rule 3     expression -> term
Rule 4     term -> NUMBER

Terminals, with rules where they appear

MINUS                : 2
NUMBER               : 4
PLUS                 : 1
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 2 0
term                 : 1 2 3

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . expression
    (1) expression -> . expression PLUS term
    (2) expression -> . expression MINUS term
    (3) expression -> . term
    (4) term -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    expression                     shift and go to state 1
    term                           shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> expression .
    (1) expression -> expression . PLUS term
    (2) expression -> expression . MINUS term

    PLUS            shift and go to state 4
    MINUS           shift and go to state 5


state 2

    (3) expression -> term .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 3 (expression -> term .)
    MINUS           reduce using rule 3 (expression -> term .)
    $end            reduce using rule 3 (expression -> term .)


state 3

    (4) term -> NUMBER .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 4 (term -> NUMBER .)
    MINUS           reduce using rule 4 (term -> NUMBER .)
    $end            reduce using rule 4 (term -> NUMBER .)


state 4

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS . term
    (4) term -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    term                           shift and go to state 6

state 5

    (2) expression -> expression MINUS . term
    (4) term -> . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 3

    term                           shift and go to state 7

state 6

    (1) expression -> expression PLUS term .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS term .)
    MINUS           reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS term .)
    $end            reduce using rule 1 (expression -> expression PLUS term .)


state 7

    (2) expression -> expression MINUS term .

    PLUS            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> expression MINUS term .)
    MINUS           reduce using rule 2 (expression -> expression MINUS term .)
    $end            reduce using rule 2 (expression -> expression MINUS term .)
